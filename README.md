# Fundamentals of AI - Course Projects

This repository contains solutions and implementations of projects from the Fundamentals of AI course. Each folder corresponds to a homework assignment or practical exercise exploring classic AI problems and techniques.

## Project Summaries

### Computer Tasks

- **HW1 - Search Algorithms:**  
  Implementation and comparison of classic search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Random, Greedy, A*) to explore and solve state space problems.

- **HW2 - N Queens Problem (Hill Climbing):**  
  Solves the N Queens puzzle using the hill climbing algorithm, demonstrating local search and heuristic optimization techniques.

- **HW3 - N×N Lloyd Puzzle PDDL Generator:**  
  Generates PDDL problem files for the N×N Lloyd puzzle, enabling automated planning experiments and solver evaluations.

### Practical Exercises

- **Practical2 - Knight Questions:**  
  Solves two knight traversal problems on a chessboard: finding the minimal path between two points and a full-board knight’s tour traversal.

- **Practical5 - 3x3 Puzzle:**  
  Contains PDDL domain and problem files for the Lloyd 3x3 sliding puzzle, used for automated planning experiments.

### Semester Project

- **SemesterProjectZUM - Sudoku Solver (CSP):**  
  Implements a Sudoku solver by modeling the 9×9 puzzle as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Uses backtracking search with forward-checking (via python-constraint) to assign digits while respecting Sudoku rules. This method is then compared to the standard backtracking approach (spoiler - it's faster).
